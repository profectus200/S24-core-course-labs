## Justifying the choice of Flask

- Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-use framework suitable for small to medium-sized web applications.
- It follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard, making it compatible with a wide range of web servers.
- Flask provides simplicity and flexibility, allowing developers to quickly build web applications without unnecessary
  overhead.
- Flask has a vibrant community and extensive documentation, making it easy to find solutions to common problems and
  learn best practices.

## Best Practices Applied in the Web Application

- **Modularization**: The application code is organized into separate files for better maintainability and readability.
  The
  main application logic is in app.py, while HTML templates are stored in the templates folder.
- **Use of Framework**: Flask, a popular micro web framework, is chosen for its simplicity and flexibility. It provides
  the
  necessary tools to build web applications efficiently.
- **Timezone Handling**: The application handles timezones correctly by using Python's datetime module along with the
  timezone and timedelta classes. This ensures accurate display of the current time in Moscow.
- **Template Rendering**: HTML templates are used for rendering the web page content. This separates the presentation
  layer
  from the application logic, following the principle of separation of concerns.

## Coding Standards, Testing, and Code Quality

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: The code follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code, ensuring consistency and readability.
  This includes consistent indentation, naming conventions, and code structure.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented to catch and handle exceptions gracefully. This ensures that
  the
  application remains stable and resilient under different scenarios.
- **Testing**: While automated tests are not explicitly implemented in this example, manual testing is conducted to
  verify the functionality of the application. This includes testing for proper rendering of the web page and updating
  of the time
  upon page refresh.
- **Code Review**: Peer code review is encouraged to identify potential issues, improve code quality, and ensure
  adherence to coding standards. This collaborative approach helps catch bugs early and improve overall code
  maintainability.

# Continuous Integration Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices I've implemented in my CI workflows.

## Our Practices

1. **Fast Pipelines:** I strive to keep my build and test times as short as possible to provide quick feedback.

2. **Fail Fast:** My workflows are structured to fail as soon as an error occurs to save time and resources.

3. **Caching:** I use caching to speed up our workflows, being careful to only cache necessary files.

4. **CI Configuration in Code:** My CI configuration is version controlled in my code repository, allowing for easy
   updates.

5. **Visibility of CI Results:** I use badges in my README to show the status of my CI workflows.

6. **Security:** I avoid hardcoding secrets in our configuration files and use secret management tools to handle
   sensitive data.

7. **Parallelization:** I run jobs in parallel where possible to reduce my workflow execution time.

8. **Automation:** I automate as much of our process as possible, including code formatting, testing, building, and
   deployment.
